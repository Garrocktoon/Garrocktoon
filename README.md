- 👋 Hi, I’m @Garrocktoon
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating on music with other "hopefully" creative musicians!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create GitHub repositories, of which I'm not completely ignorant, but want to learn more.
- 💞️ I’m a "50 something" year old drummer\keyboard player\writer\composer, looking to collaborate on musical ideas of a more progressive nature with other Musician's\or Vocalists. I'm a drummer "1rst and foremost" who knows enough about music theory to put most guitarists I've met to shame. I'm fairly tech savvy knowing my way around a DAW and have literally thousands of music ideas, and samples of my ideas. Some of my infuences include: The Dregs, RUSH, Jean Luc Ponty, just to name a few.
- 📫 How to reach me is through the following email. (Please no spammers or scammers)
